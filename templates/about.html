            <p class="description">
                QuantxAI is a cutting-edge platform designed to provide unbreakable data security through Quantum Encryption and AI-driven vulnerability assessment. By integrating Quantum Key Distribution (BB84) with AES encryption, QuantxAI ensures secure file storage and transfer, while its Machine Learning-based vulnerability detector proactively identifies security threats.
            </p>
            <h2>Quantum-Secure Data Encryption & Decryption</h2>
            <p>QuantxAI leverages Quantum Key Distribution (BB84) with 20 quantum bits and 1024 shots, combined with AES encryption, to ensure unbreakable file security. When a file is encrypted, a quantum-generated key is embedded within the file name in hexadecimal format, making it highly resistant to interception. This ensures that only the intended recipient can access the data. For decryption, the system first retrieves and deciphers the quantum-encrypted key, then uses it to unlock the file, ensuring a seamless and ultra-secure data-sharing experience. With this hybrid quantum-AES encryption approach, QuantxAI provides a future-proof solution against cyber threats and unauthorized access.</p>
            <h2>ML-Based Vulnerability Detection</h2>
            <p>QuantxAIâ€™s ML-powered vulnerability detection uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to analyze files for potential threats. By scanning for malicious keywords and patterns, the system accurately identifies security vulnerabilities that could indicate malware, exploits, or other cyber threats. This proactive approach ensures that files are assessed before storage or sharing, preventing security breaches. With real-time detection and intelligent analysis, QuantxAI provides a robust layer of cybersecurity, helping users safeguard their data from emerging threats.</p>
